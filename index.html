                <h3><u> Tarot: The Chaotic Card Based Fighting Game </u></h3>
                <p style="margin-right: 350px;">
					Note: Game was created in a team. I didn't create every aspect of the game.
                    Desc: "Tarot" is a 2d platform fighter where two players, fight in a first to 3 wins,
                    on a small platform and attempt to push the other off of the platform, or hit them enough times
                    until their health reaches 0, before they do the same to you. The
                    gimmick of this game is, before the match, you and your opponent choose 2 "cards each"
					the card options are either battlefield modifiers or weapons. <br><br>
					Engine: Godot v4 <br><br>

                <p style="margin-right: 350px;">
					Note: Game was created in a team. I didn't create every aspect of the game.
                    Desc: "Mr Nibbles" is a game in which the player is a mouse attempting to survive
                    throughout 3 days, this is accomplished by eating cheese, to maintain hunger,
                    avoiding the menacing cat, and avoiding traps that get in the way. On the third day
					your goal is to escape the house through the newly opened window. <br><br>

                <p style="margin-right: 350px;">
                    Desc: This Bumper car game was meant to be a 1-4, (though 1 player can't really do anything
					by themselves), player free for all where players attempt to knock each other off the platform,
					and to be the last player on the platform, However, There are few mechanics missing, such as death
					that has yet to be added. <br><br>

                    Desc: This project was made as an attempt to replicate a first person shooting style
					game, it's simply used to enhance players reaction skills, by displaying a "score"
					which tracks how many shapes were clicked on within the span of 10 seconds, and can
					be played multiple times. <br><br>

                <p style="margin-right: 350px;">
                    Desc: I wanted to make a close replica of BlackJack that follows most of the
					rules a traditional game would. This includes the player starting with two cards, against a 
					dealer who has been given two cards yet 1 is visible until the player is done drawing cards.
					The player is given the actions, hit, double down, stand, and occasionally the split option.
					at the beginning of the match the user is given also an option for help in case the rules
					aren't clear. For this version of the game, the split option is only available once.
					everything else is mostly traditional. <br><br>
